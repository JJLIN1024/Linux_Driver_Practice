# Linux_Driver_Practice

## Overview

This repository contains practice code of Linux kernel modules, for the purpose of learning Linux kernel module programming while studying [The Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide](https://sysprog21.github.io/lkmpg/) and [Linux_Driver_Tutorial](https://github.com/Johannes4Linux/Linux_Driver_Tutorial).

The modules were compiled and tested on Ubuntu server 22.04.3 LTS, raspberry pi 4.

During the learning process, I found [The Linux Kernel documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/index.html) really helpful, which provides explanations for various api's functionality it provides.
